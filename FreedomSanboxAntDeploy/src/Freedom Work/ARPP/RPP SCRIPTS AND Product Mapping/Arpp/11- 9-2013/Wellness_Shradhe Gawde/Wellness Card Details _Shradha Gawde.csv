Many people we have met and worked with begin here. Budgeting exercises may help in getting a better idea of where money gets spent. Most important after this, is investing the surplus available in the right places. Only that will help you reach your goals. Budgeting, if followed by the exhilarating goal setting exercise creates magic. This will lead into drawing out a workable road map to your goals and seeing your dreams unravel right in front of you.","a2U200000007eKwEAI","3.0"

You will agree that bad things can happen to any of us anytime. We should be in a position to bounce back and move on. Most critical at those times will be having a reasonable amount of money to do so. Usually we advice our members to set aside an amount equal to 3 months to 12 months of household expenses for this purpose. This will however depend on individual circumstances – like industry working in, nature of job, alternate employability, other income sources etc. Also important is that this money is kept in a safe place which is also easily convertible to cash. This sum will have to be made accessible to your closest family also, just in case you are not in a position to handle it yourself. That way you can , with peace in the mind, pursue your other goals.","a2U200000007eKxEAI","3.0"

On being asked how your family will cope in case of an unfortunate event to the key earning member in your household, you have said “You are moderately sure”. Most people understand the criticality of protecting their families only when a tragic event happens to themselves or in their closest circle. However the more responsible people (like people we work with!) sufficiently protect themselves against the various risks that face them – risk of untimely death, risk of falling sick, risk of a disability, risk of losing / destruction of assets etc. And usually if risk protection is half done, inadequate or inappropriate it is useless. A proper assessment of risk, quantifying the possible monetary loss in case the risk happens and making the right choice to protect against it gives people the confidence to go after more wealth, because the wealth they already possess is reasonably protected. Isn’t a bird in hand to be protected well, before going after the birds in the bush?","a2U200000007eKyEAI","3.0"

In our lives we have some basic responsibilities to handle – like taking care of parents, putting our children through school and college etc. We also have some dreams we nurture for ourselves like travelling the world, pursuing an expensive hobby, building wealth for the children etc. These responsibilities and dreams cost money, some of them a lot of money. A lot of people start here and we have ourselves seen them graduate to beautifully articulating their goals, putting down a proper plan of action, giving it money values, budgeting meticulously to provide for the investments and very actively progressing towards their goals. They achieve their goals by design live with confidence.","a2U200000007eKzEAI","2.0"

A good retirement plan takes into consideration your life style, your current expenses, planned year of retirement, what kind of lifestyle you choose to live after your retirement, how much will your expenses be at that time, what other hobbies or interests will you pursue and costs for the same, how much safety net for emergencies will you require, what best insurances can you get, how to invest your money in such a way that it is safe as well as will last your lifetime while beating inflation and more..
Retirement planning is not really a one-time affair. It is a commitment to safeguard your and spouse’s future and requires to be worked on diligently. Regular review of personal situations and rebalancing of the portfolio to stay aligned to the goals is of paramount importance.
Many people we work with come in at this stage of being moderately prepared. They all have put in place robust retirement plans – they know how much they will need, how much their employment will give them, how much they have to invest regularly, where to invest, which assets to use when, what they intend to do after retirement to keep themselves happy and healthy and much more. They work on it and look forward to retiring in style.","a2U200000007eL0EAI","3.0"

Debt is almost a necessary evil – it helps us build wealth when used for the right reasons and drains all wealth when taken for the wrong reasons. Staying out of debt, particularly bad debt – debt that does not give you more money and does not make you wealthier – is the first step towards financial freedom. Having no debt actually means freedom from the shackles, freedom from having to do things just for money. 
You could explore options to get out of loans faster. Sometime you could consolidate your loans, take lower cost loans, renegotiate terms of existing loans and look at ways of getting debt free earlier than scheduled. About 40% of people we work with have plans that will help them get out of loan 3 – 5 years earlier, saving huge sums of money being paid out as interest and also protecting the assets they bought on loans against risks of death or disability to the person who is repaying the loan.","a2U200000007eL1EAI","3.0"

The moment you have either of the two it is a rather risk management strategy to have a succession plan. Death or disability does not happen when we expect. But whenever it happens, the money earned so hard has to be accessible by and useful to whoever it is meant for. Ensuring that your important investments are jointly held, nominations are done and updated, having a Will to safeguard the interests of those you care for, giving a Power of Attorney to be used if a need arises, forming Trusts for specific needs if you have any - are all safety strategies and must do for everyone who loves and cares for his / her family.","a2U200000007eL2EAI","2.0"
