																				This is a pretty personal experience, but I want to
																				share it here, because it was a great learning piece
																				too. This experience reiterated the fact it is not
																				just the company’s credentials, not your technical
																				expertise or for that matter not even the actual
																				financial plan that a client is looking for. There
																				is a part of you, your personal characteristics,
																				your faith and sense of ethics which you bring on
																				the table for the client to see, for him to trust
																				that you would be a worthy partner in his journey.
																				And this cannot be faked. It is just there, or not
																				there. That’s it!<br /> <br /> There was this
																				really high net worth client I was trying to engage
																				with. He was a professional, well read, well placed,
																				middle aged person who was referred to me by another
																				member. The client was clean, all money was
																				accounted for, he diligently paid his taxes, had a
																				great accountant who maintained his books well. He
																				clearly believed in doing things only within the
																				legal framework.<br /> <br /> The initial meeting
																				was cool – in the literal sense, the prospect did
																				not warm up at all! I somehow liked him and was sure
																				I would learn a lot if I got an opportunity to
																				enroll him and so was really desperate to use the
																				opportunity well. I forced him into meeting me once
																				again, did his diagnostics, went well prepared and
																				this time he seemed to turn around a bit but was
																				still unwilling to take the plunge. So I insisted on
																				him meeting me again along with a senior in my
																				organization.<br /> <br /> So it was, the next
																				meeting with Vinita our Sr. Manager – Financial
																				planning. She was her usual self - full of common
																				sense and conviction. The client seemed to get the
																				drift and realized that professional, unbiased help
																				with his money would be of great use - but should it
																				be Ffreedom, should it be Bharti were things he
																				wasn’t sure about yet.<br /> <br /> And then came
																				this..<br /> <br /> He told Vinita that if it was
																				going to be this young girl who will be my planner,
																				I want her to answer a question. You stay off this
																				and don’t give your opinion. Vinita retreated. He
																				turned to me and asked, “Bharti, like I told you I
																				am clean, maintain my books neatly and pay all taxes
																				due on time. But let’s assume, based on some
																				information the income tax office reopens my
																				accounts and rechecks some documents. There is this
																				inspector who comes to me and says that I owe the IT
																				department Rs. 20 lacs, as it has been detected that
																				I concealed some income. After a while he says he
																				would overlook this, if I paid him a bribe of Rs 2
																				lacs. What do you think I should do? If this
																				happened to you what would you do?”<br /> <br />

																				Usually I would have looked back at Vinita to
																				understand what she thought, but somehow this time I
																				did not think much. I just blurted out, “What? Why
																				would you pay this guy Rs. 2 lacs? If it were me, I
																				would contest his claim that I owe the IT department
																				any money at all. I would take it up appropriately
																				and clear up my books, if necessary. Otherwise, this
																				would become a precedence. No way would I pay bribe
																				like this”<br /> <br /> There was silence. And
																				then there were smiles. He signed up the very day
																				and continues to be a very valuable WOW client. <br />

																				<br /> <strong>Bharti Punjabi, Financial
																					Planner @ Ffreedom</strong>
