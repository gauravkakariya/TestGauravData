However, from a legal point of view, a nominee is just a trustee not an owner of the assets. And without a will, there is no guarantee about how your assets will be allocated…</p>
                                <p> One normally nominates people close to themselves with a view of assigning them as legal heirs to various assets. You might want to distribute your wealth between your spouse, children, parents, charity, etc. It is also possible that you may want to exclude specific people from becoming your beneficiaries. However, if you do not completely understand the rules governing nominations of different financial products, you may be in for a rude shock…</p>
                                 	<strong>A trustee not an owner</strong>
                                 	<div>A nominee, as defined by law, is meant to act as a trustee of the assets and is not the rightful owner of the assets. In simple terms, a nominee is a caretaker for the assets and is legally bound to transfer ownership of the assets to the legal heirs of the deceased. he legal heirs are the people as described in a will. In case no will exists, the legal heirs are ascertained as per the succession laws of the state. A nominee too can be the only or one of the legal heirs.</div>
                               	 	<p></p>
                               	 	<strong>A nominee makes the ‘afterlife’ simpler</strong>
                                 	<div>One always wants to ensure that if one dies, all his assets like insurance, mutual funds, shares, etc. should be easily transferred to the legal heirs. However, without assigning a nominee for these assets the process of transfer can be quite cumbersome, involving a lot of paperwork for each financial asset individually.</div>
                                 <p>If a nominee exists, the financial firms are bound to transfer all ownership of the assets to the nominee, who is then responsible for allocating the assets between the legal heirs.</p>
                                 <p>Let’s look at how nomination rules vary for different financial products –</p>
                                
	                                <ul>
	                                  <li><strong>Life Insurance</strong>
	                                 		<div>Appointing a nominee is a standard practice while purchasing life insurance products. As per life insurance norms your first nominee has to be one of your family members. One can also appoint a third person as a nominee provided you can prove to the insurance firm that the person as some insurable interest for you. A nominee in case of life insurance acts only as a trustee. He is liable to transfer the settlement received from the insurance firm to the rightful heir of the deceased.</div>
	                                  </li>
	                                  <p></p>
	                                  <li><strong>Mutual Funds</strong>
	                                  		<div>One can nominate up to three people while purchasing the units in a mutual fund. While a minor can also be nominated, one needs to specify the minor’s guardian as well. The nomination for the fund can also be changed at a later date if required.</div>
	                                  </li>
	                                  <p></p>
	                                  <li><strong>Shares</strong>
	                                  		<div>In the case of shares, the rules governing nomination are different. According to the Companies Act and Depositories Act a nomination is made with the intent to transfer the ownership of the shares after a person’s demise. Hence, any nomination made for shares gives the nominee the right to ownership in the event of one’s death.</div>
	                                  </li>
	                                  <p></p>
	                                  <li><strong>Public Provident Fund (PPF)</strong>
	                                  		<div>Creating a nomination for a PPF account is extremely important. If you do not nominate anyone as a legal heir for your PPF account, they can only get a maximum of Rs. one lakh from it. Hence, if your account has five lakhs, the balance four lakhs will not be transferred to your heirs in the absence of a nomination.</div>
	                                  </li>
	                                  <p></p>
	                                  <li><strong>Bank Accounts and Deposits </strong>
	                                  		<div>Any money that you may have in a bank account (saving or current) or bank deposit (fixed or recurring) only provides the nominee the right of a trustee. The nominee cannot make any claim to the sum if he/she is not a legal heir of the deceased.</div>
	                                  </li>
	                                  <p></p>
	                                </ul>
	                                	<p>If you want to ensure that your dependents or survivors get their due share from your assets after your death, ensure that you complete the nomination formalities for each asset class you own. Also, in addition to nomination, prepare a will detailing how you want your estate to be distributed. By completing the formalities of both – nomination and will – you will make life simpler for your survivors.</p>
