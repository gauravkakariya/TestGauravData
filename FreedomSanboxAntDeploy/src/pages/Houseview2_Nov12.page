                              <td valign="top" style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#333333; font-size:12px; text-align:justify;">The month of October was a quiet one for the markets on the  international as well as on the domestic front. Most equity indices around the  world gave back a chunk of their gains from the rally post QE3. FII’s have been  net positive on the Indian markets and have pumped around Rs.3.6 billion alone  in the month of Sept. The BSE Sensex is trading at its 1 year high which has  helped up sentiments to a certain extent. However, the increasing number of  scams that are being exposed off late may act as a deterrent for further  foreign inflows. Uncertainty around implementation of certain reforms has kept  both foreign as well as domestic investors on the edge.<br />

                                <br />

                                Inflation continues to move higher and the recent reading at  7.81% does ring a few alarm bells. On the other hand even though QE3 has been  announced the commodity prices have not gone up. So let us understand what  these events mean for us – the common man in our country.<br />

                                <br />

                                Inflation is showing no signs of abating which means that  the common man continues to pay more for his daily necessities. The fuel price  has been increased by the government thus burdening all of us further. The gold  prices have also shot up because of increase in demand due to the upcoming festive  season. With the marriage season round the corner, high gold prices mean shell  out more to buy jewellery, which by the way cannot be compromised on in our  great country.  The RBI is also concerned  about inflation and much to the chagrin of the Ministry of Finance is not  reducing the rates. The markets keenly look forward to the same as that would help  increase corporate profits and people will start investing in the markets and  that will improve the sentiments of investing public.<br />

                                <br />

                                The dollar has appreciated  over the last few months, giving some respite to importers of goods and  commodities. India imports almost 80% of its annual oil consumption, an  appreciating dollar will help reduce the burden of the government of India. The  NRI’s working abroad would not be too happy as their remittances to India would  now be of less worth in rupee terms.<br />

                                <br />

                                The common man can take heart at the fact that things are  improving on the economic and political front in our country with the spate of  reforms getting a breather. A better economic and political scenario would mean  that businesses will flourish which in turn would mean more jobs, better  opportunities and prosperity. As an economy we are still not there in terms of  distance but at least the direction is correct. We can only hope that things  get better from here and be optimistic about the future of our country, while  doing our bit.<br />
