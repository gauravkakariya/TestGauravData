The IRDA seems to have  taken cognizance of the various grey areas in the health insurance industry  much before this show was aired.<br />
                                <br />
                                On 30th May 2012,  IRDA published an exposure draft of IRDA (Health Insurance) Regulations 2012. Excerpts  from the exhaustive 44 page new draft regulations for Health Insurance released  is given below: <br />
                                <br />
                                <strong>Policy Benefits</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                  <li>Health  Insurance product would henceforth be&nbsp;renewable for lifetime. This will be a very useful benefit, if the  proposals come through.</li>
                                  <li>Grace  period for renewal of Health Insurance which was earlier 15 days, will now be  30 days</li>
                                  <li>Health  Insurance policies from life insurance companies would have a <em>minimum</em>&nbsp;term  of 4 years</li>
                                  <li>Health  insurance policies from non-life companies could have a&nbsp;<em>maximum</em>&nbsp;term  of 3 years.&nbsp;</li>
                                  <li>When  children have to move out of the family floater policies proposed by their  parents and get their own insurance policies, clear procedures for<strong>&nbsp;</strong>smooth migration<strong> </strong>is proposed</li>
                                  <li>Cashless Cards should be issued within 15 days&nbsp;of issue of the Health Insurance  Policy. No Fresh cards would be issued every year on renewal. The same cashless  card would be continued every year. </li>
                                </ol>
                                <p><strong>Denial of  coverage and loading</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                  <li>Communication  of denial of coverage, and loading on fresh health insurance proposals should  be in writing</li>
                                  <li>Now  if you make a small little claim on your ten year old policy also, the  insurance company can load your next year premium. This will change with the  proposal that, only when the insured makes claims in 3 consecutive years and  when all the three years claims put together exceed 5 times the renewal premium  payable will the insurance company be permitted to load the renewal premium</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p><strong>Claims</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                  <li>Senior  citizens will now have a separate grievance redressal cell for claims</li>
                                  <li>If  you have more than one insurance policy, earlier you had to run around between  the companies splitting your claim based on contribution to risk. Going  forward, you would can choose which product to use and contribution would be  effected between the insurance companies without involving you</li>
                                  <li>If  all documents are submitted, insurers will be mandatorily required to<strong>&nbsp;</strong>settle claims within 30 days&nbsp;of  submission of complete documents. </li>
                                  <li>Insurance  companies cannot reject claims on technical grounds of delayed submission of  claim form and documents, if the customer can provide valid reasons for the  delay&nbsp;</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p><strong>Changes in policy  terms, wordings</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                  <li>If  the insurers were changing any terms in the policy at the time of renewal, that  will have to be communicated with the policy holder 3 months before the renewal  date</li>
                                  <li>Policy  wordings of all their products have to be mandatorily put up on the website</li>
                                  <li>Renewal  Procedure (regarding maximum age, changes in coverage at later ages, upgrading  cover, loading charges) would have to be clearly&nbsp;detailed&nbsp;in the  policy wordings</li>
                                  <li>Now no more company specific exclusions and claim  forms etc. IRDA plans to standardize certain definitions, exclusions and  forms&nbsp;documents like  claim forms</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p><strong>TPA</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                  <li>The TPA will no more be responsible for hospital  network. That would now be the responsibility of the insurance company. Insurance companies would directly administer  the network and would be held responsible for issues that arise in the network. </li>
                                  <li>This  would question the role of TPAs going forward, if this came into force</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Whether these  changes will be applicable on existing products or not is not quite clear. <br />
                                  But please do  note that these are only &quot;draft&quot; regulations issued with the  intention of getting feedback and inputs from the industry, including  policyholders and their forums. These would be revised in due course, and the  final regulations released in 2-3 months. </p>
                                To us, IRDA seems to  be keen on clearing up the bottle necks in making health insurance available  and acceptable to all. But whether this will improve the current dismal 2%  penetration of health insurance in India, is tough to say.</td>
