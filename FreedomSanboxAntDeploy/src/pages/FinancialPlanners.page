										<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" style="font-size:12px;">As financial planners, the single most common questions that we are asked is – ‘how financial planning helps me?’ Even today, the awareness about financial planning is low in India. While the basic purpose of financial planning is to help you plan yourself financial life to reach your various goals including buying a new house, your dream car or a family trip to Disneyland, one has to make sure that your financial plan is always holistic in nature. This financial plan is a balance sheet not just for you, but your family that tells how you are place financially and where you would want to be to, financially. <br /><br />
										A financial plan takes into  account some of the basic factors in your life to adequately prepare you for  the various events in your life –&nbsp;both foreseen and unforeseen. Some of  the important facets it tackles are - </font>
									</p>

		                            <ul>
		                            	<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333"  style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Create a contingency plan</strong>: Having an emergency plan is always helpful. Creating a back up means that when emergency strikes your family, you are not caught in a conundrum and will be financially secure enough to get out of it. This could be a medical emergency that could strike without warning or a event that you wouldn’t expect at that stage of your life. Certain incidents like an earthquake can strike at any time. This could not only mean loss and damage to life but also primary residential property. At times like these, being prepared with a contingency plan would mean that you have all the available resources to help you build up your strength from this situation. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></li>

										<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Risk Planning: &nbsp;</strong>Every aspect of life has risk involved, which can cause damage to health, wealth and assets.  As financial planners, we have come across so many clients who rarely think about them and how it would affect their life. But we always make it a point to tell them about risk planning and what would happen if they cover themselves in such situations. Financial plan helps in not only being prepared for unknown risks that would affect them in the future but also provide a security net for their wealth. </font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
										
										<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Prioritizing your dreams into quantifiable goals: </strong>Having an idea of what you want to achieve in life is a very important part of life itself. While people often believe what they want, they hardly ever know how to get there. A financial plan can help you not only understand when you would want that goal to be fulfilled but also the method that you would want to use to get there. Your investment is the total savings that you get after you have deducted all your expenses from your income. And when you save for a defined goal for a specific time to achieve a define rate of returns, your saving becomes an investment. I have often noticed in India, we are good savers, but when it comes to investing, we are pretty much lost. Conversion of savings into investments helps in turning your dream into a reality. </font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
										<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Retirement Planning: &nbsp;</strong>Retirement is the time when you don’t work for money, but work to enjoy yourself. And your retirement is as important as the rest of your life. Having a retirement plan in place ensures that you do not have to give up on your standard of living, even after you have stopped earning. An appropriate financial plan can help you allocate your current resources without cutting into your daily needs and yet making sure that you have enough for the future. This plan would also help you with all your for financial and medical expenses that you may incur during this time. </font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
										<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Estate Planning: &nbsp;</strong>One question that people are always afraid to answer is what would happen to my loved ones after I am gone. And while they are scared of finding that answer, I always suggest estate planning. A financial plan can help in allocating your wealth and resources amongst your loved ones, in a legal manner. I also advice them that creating a will with help of a financial plan is a way to make sure that they are taken care even after you are long gone. Estate planning can help in structuring many charitable goals including leaving certain amount of wealth to0 your grand kids as a trust fund etc. </font></li>
									</ul>
										<p>
											<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" style="font-size:12px;"> A financial plan can help you not only plan for your present but also your future. And it can definitely lead to a hassle free financial future. Failing to plan is planning to fail! </font>
