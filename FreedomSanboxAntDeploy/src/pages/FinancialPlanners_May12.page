                              <td valign="top" style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#333333; font-size:12px; text-align:justify;"><p>I  met Mr.Deodhar after a seminar organised by Ffreedom when I went to do  his&nbsp;complimentary session at the&nbsp;office. After the session got over,  he was quite happy with the&nbsp;whole idea of Financial Planning and that he  might sign up. As I was about to get his membership forms filled he said that he  would like to discuss this with his mother before finally deciding. My heart  sank because from my experience I have seen that people who&nbsp;go to check  with the women at home rarely revert. I lost hope a bit. But I still persisted  that I would like to meet his mother and clarify any doubts that she might  have.<br />
                                <br />
                                I  got the opportunity to meet this glorious, wise old woman who had struggled  hard to do the best for her son. She had lost her husband when quite young and  had had to face the challenges of supporting her family all by herself. She had  the best interest of her son always in her mind. I put on my listening cap and  patiently listened to her entire inspiring story and somewhere I started  believing that she has herself done a fantastic job of her finances. I also  feared that she might dismiss financial planning saying that it did not make  sense because it was nothing different from what she had done herself.<br />
                                <br />
                                But  she was quite engaging.&nbsp;She shared with me details of her portfolio that  consisted predominantly of fixed return instruments like FD, PPF and post  office schemes.&nbsp;Quite understandably so, considering the fact that she has  worked very hard and save little by little and&nbsp;she was unwilling to take  any kind of risk or&nbsp;venture into investment options that she did not understand.  &nbsp;She had a few insurances policies that were not giving desired returns. I  decided to use this opportunity.<br />
                                <br />
                                I  explained to her how vital and important pension was to her post retirement  cashflows. Would her son enjoy the same kind of benefits too? No, because he  worked for the private sector. I explained how the family and  societal&nbsp;scenario have changed and she readily agreed. How options have  improved, how interest rates have come down and many more were discussed.<br />
                                <br />
                                She  agreed that the situation has changed. Her son may not have the same drive as  she did while managing money. He being an IT professional may not have the time  to dedicate for money matters. She herself might have missed out opportunities  because she did not get the right kind of help. She wanted professional help  for her son and particularly wanted me to nudge him so much, that he would act  and take control of his finances.<br />
                                <br />
                                This  was a great learning experience for me. I learnt that I should assume nothing  and should always go with an open mind while going to meet clients. They could  always be surprises. I understood why she commanded the respect of people  around her, me including - hard work, willingness to embrace change, open  minded to new ideas, focus and clarity of thought that her son's well being  alone is important. When they signed up I should say, I felt more responsible  than happy.<br />
                                <br />
