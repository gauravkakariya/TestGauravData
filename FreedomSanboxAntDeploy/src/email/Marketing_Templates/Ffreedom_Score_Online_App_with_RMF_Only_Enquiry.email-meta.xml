‘Our truest life is when we are in our dreams awake’– Ffreedom Financial Planners 
  
A bit about us: We at Ffreedom believe that the term ‘financially free’ refers to a person that has significant savings or income and thus has peace of mind and the satisfaction of being able to do what he wants and when he wants to do it. We believe that today people are under incredible financial pressure which often leads to stress, worry and impaired relationships. Our aim is to empower the person with the knowledge which would help reduce or eliminate this negativity which would result in the person being financially free. The advice that we deliver to our clients is through expert Financial Consultants who are Certified Financial Planners*. 
*There are currently only 931 Certified Financial Planners in India - source Financial Planning Standards Board of India.
Kindly please let me know if you would be interested in availing this complimentary consultation.
