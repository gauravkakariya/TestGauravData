    <textOnly>Dear {!Account.Name}, 

We are very proud to announce the arrival of “The Ffreedom World”, a portal exclusively created for Ffreedom clients. The Ffreedom World is defined as “Piecing Together Your World of Financial Freedom” where we endeavor to help our clients live their dreams &amp; achieve financial freedom. 
Some of the key features of The Ffreedom World are:
·    It shall enable you to access all your personal &amp; family financial details
·    You can see your financial plan and details about your financial planner
·    You can keep a track of your investments through the portfolio reports
·    You can participate in idea building where you can come up with ideas &amp; post them on the ideas’ section. So post your ideas and we will try to make it happen
·    You can also post your queries/questions to us and your financial planner would revert back with a solution
·    We have also created a learning centre, which enables you to learn more about what is happening in the financial service industry/personal finance. We hope that these articles help you understand finance better
 The Ffreedom World is in the beta (trial) phase where we would like you to give us your feedback about the portal as we are sending this to a select set of clients.   
This portal is created to bring you closer to us and we have also built in some social &amp; educative element to the portal which will help you socialize in the Ffreedom Family &amp; keep you up-to date on what&apos;s happening around you.
 
This email will be followed by another email with our Ffreedom World login ID and its password. Feel free to access it through our website www.ffreedom.in
