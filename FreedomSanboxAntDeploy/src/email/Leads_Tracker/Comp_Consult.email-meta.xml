What to expect?  The session shall include the following:
      
 A Financial Health Check up: It will give you an indication about how healthy your financial situation is. This assessment measures the quality of your personal finance habits &amp; your results are based on your own expectations.
                 
  Your goals: Our Financial Planner shall concentrate on understanding your lifestyle, needs and goals, rather than on promoting specific products or investments. And hence helps you create a road map to start living your dreams.
