Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Just when everything we read and hear around us about the economy and stock markets seem to indicate doom and bad days ahead, "Good returns are seldom made on investments made in good times" -says Mr.Prashant Jain, ED and CIO - HDFC Mutual fund.
 
Comparisons on how investments made in good times perform against those made in wrong times, how all of us have developed an impeccable expertise at mistiming markets, what to expect from equities and gold in the future and also a candid view of the key challenges India is facing today and how that would impact all of us is covered in this exclusive report. 

Mr.Jain's contra view and fundamentally sound logic is compelling and this report is a must read for every investor.
 
Regards,
Team Ffreedom
