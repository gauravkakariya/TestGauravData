    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.Name}
 
&apos;Our perfect life is when we are in our dreams awake’

Today people dream &amp; forget. Imagine them living their dreams. No dream/goal is achievable without a plan. This becomes even more pertinent when the dreams &amp; goals are attached
to financial requirements. 
We believe &quot;Failing to Plan is Planning to Fail.&quot;

At Ffreedom Financial Planner, we understand this problem &amp; address it by providing Financial Planning though our proprietary financial models and help achieve one’s goals. In short - we enable people live their dreams.

We believe that today, due to lack of knowledge &amp; time and enormous misguidance, most of the people are finding themselves lost in this financial jungle, which often leads to stress, worry and impaired relationships. This becomes even more significant for salaried people. Our aim is to empower them with knowledge &amp; planning, which would help them being financially free.

Ffreedom Financial Planners is a fee-based Financial Planning firm. We take great pride as we are into the business of reliving stress.
