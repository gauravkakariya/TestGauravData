    <subject>Charity !!! Make It Your Goal...</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.Name}, 
As Henry Ward Beecher once said &quot;In this world it is not what we take up, but what we give up, that makes us rich&quot;, hence today it has become equally important to give back along with trying to make a better living for your self &amp; your family. To have CHARITY as a goal is like any other life goal. At Ffreedom we believe in assisting our clients to explore all possible opportunities that will help them live their dreams &amp; there is no noble dream than charity. Inform your Financial Planner to add CHARITY as a goal, if you haven’t done it already. Along with HDFC MF, Ffreedom brings to you a cause that is close to all our hearts &quot; HDFC Debt Fund for Cancer Cure&quot; a 3 year close ended capital protection oriented income scheme. This is among the first of a series of initiatives we are planning to bring to you in future. Cancer is one of the most common non-communicable diseases in India. In 2008, nearly one million new cancer cases were detected in the country. The loss of lives as a result of this disease was more than 6 lakhs in that year.  However, when detected early, cancer is curable in many cases. Especially in the case of children, the survival rate is very high if treatment is started immediately upon diagnosis. However, reeling under the pressure of prohibitive treatment costs, cancer cure is unaffordable to most families in India. Apart from the huge direct medical costs, there are many other hidden costs, such as expenses on food and nutritional supplements, travel, loss of earnings due to ill-health, etc.  Today, the medical cost of cancer treatment for a patient is approx. Rs. 2 to 12 lakhs, depending upon the type of treatment. Every patient deserves a fighting chance to beat this disease through timely and complete treatment. Adequate financial aid would ensure that many patients do not give up their treatment midway and continue their fight against cancer. The cancer cause is in association with The Indian Cancer Society (ICS), a Public Charitable Trust and India’s oldest anti-cancer NGO established in 1951. The contributions to this would go in providing affordable and innovative solutions for the detection and treatment of cancer and for the post-treatment rehabilitation of survivors.  Please visit their website www.indiancancersociety.org If you would like to create a CHARITY as a goal in your financial plan contact yourFinancial Planner today or write to us at contact@ffreedom.in Together we can make a difference. Warm Regards, Ffreedom Team</textOnly>
