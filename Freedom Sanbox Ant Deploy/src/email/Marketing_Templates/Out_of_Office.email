Dear {!Account.Name},

The entire Ffreedom Team would be out of office for its Annual National Conference from the 11th to the 13th of March 2011. 


We would be having limited access to our emails & mobile's during this duration, hence we would only be able to revert to you on monday 14th March 2011.


Apologies for the inconvenience 




Regards,
Ffreedom Team
