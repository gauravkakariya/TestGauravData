    <textOnly>Dear {!Registration__c.Name},

The Ffreedom Day went really well &amp; it was really inspiring to have the whole Ffreedom Family together, along with the speakers who gave Ffreedom Talks which were not only Inspiring people but Inspiring Action.

The topics for the Ffreedom Day were on the outcomes of Financial Planning i.e. Happiness, Dreams &amp; Financial Freedom.

To keep you updated about the Happenings at the Ffreedom day, we will soon share with you the Pictures &amp; Videos of the Ffreedom Day, so that you donâ€™t miss out on the thought provoking talks &amp; fun we had at the Ffreedom Day.
