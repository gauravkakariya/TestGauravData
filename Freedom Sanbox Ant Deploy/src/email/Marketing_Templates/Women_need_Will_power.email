Adept at juggling both her worlds being a friend and confidante to her 5 year old son, Rishi at home and lending a very patient ear to her subordinates and customers at office. She shifted from Chennai to Mumbai in 2011 and took no time in adjusting to the fast paced life in the city. She is very clear about the exact auto fare from her home in Vile Parle to her office in Andheri West. She is also clear about why she made a Will. Shewanted to make sure her mother received a share of her assets in any eventuality.

	Who gets to inherit in the absence of a Will?</h2>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Let us take a look at what Section 15 and 16 indicate. The key elements that drive a Hindu married
                                                        woman's properties inheritance rules are a) the source of the property and b) a laid down sequence for
                                                        self created property. The diagram below shows how the source of property affects the inheritance. We
                                                        also look at the sequence for self created property.

	What does this imply for Bhuvanaâ€™s self created wealth?</h2>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In the sequence lies the key to Bhuvanaâ€™s desire to make a Will. As is apparent, for any self created
                                                        property, her parents feature in the third tier â€“ a tier below the heirs of her husband.
                                                        <br/>
                                                        <br/>
                                                        Thus, her husbandâ€™s sister was higher in priority than her own parents and if Bhuvana desired that her
                                                        mother have access to some of her properties, it would be possible only if she created a Will and named
                                                        her mother as one of the beneficiaries
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        <br/>
                                                        <br/>
                                                        Let us look at two illustrations to further explain the point for a Hindu married womanâ€™s self created
                                                        property if she does not have a Will
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        <em>Illustration A: Husband and children alive, husbandâ€™s parents alive, her parents alive.</em>
                                                        <br/>
                                                        <br/>
                                                        In such a case, the entire property of the woman is inherited by her husband and children and neither
                                                        her parents nor her husbandâ€™s parents stand to inherit anything.

                                                    <p>
                                                        In such a case, her entire property is inherited by her mother-in-law and her mother does not inherit
                                                        anything.

	What are the eminent people saying about this?</h2>
                                                    <p>
                                                        There are articles in the mainstream media where eminent people are making a case for amendments to
                                                        this law. The amendments desired are to take into account the Hindu married womanâ€™s parents.
