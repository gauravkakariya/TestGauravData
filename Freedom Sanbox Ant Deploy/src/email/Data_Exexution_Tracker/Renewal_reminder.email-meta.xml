    <textOnly>Dear &quot;{!Account.Name}&quot;

It has been such a pleasure being your partner in your journey towards financial freedom.

We have in the last year done the following:
&lt;&lt;Drop down to choose&gt;&gt;
- Identified the different goals you want to achieve in your life
- Drawn up a workable financial plan that will help you achieve these goals
- Protected your family against the various risks that you face
- Begun an investment plan to achieve your goals &lt;&lt;Elaborate which goals&gt;&gt;
- Better planned your taxes
- Put together a proper Succession Plan

We have come some distance, but we have a long way to go. We trust you found value and will consider it worthwhile to renew your relationship with us which is due on {!Renewal__c.Renewal_Date__c}.
Look forward to a long term rewarding association with you.

Thanks and regards
