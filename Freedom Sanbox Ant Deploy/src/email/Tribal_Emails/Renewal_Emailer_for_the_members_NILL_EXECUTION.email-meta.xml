    <textOnly>Dear {!Account.Name}

Our continuous endeavor is to help you live your dream &amp; achieve financial freedom.

To begin with, we would like to thank you for placing your trust with us and giving us an opportunity to prepare your Personalized Financial Plan.

 
We have observed that you have not acted upon your Financial Plan. We would like to state that not acting on the Financial Plan is similar to not having a Financial Plan.

At this point we would like to propose a meeting where we can review the actions we can take to implement your Financial Plan. Through this session, we will also take the opportunity of gathering fresh data [in terms of goals, income flows etc.]. Post this, your Financial Plan will be restructured &amp; we can start the implementation of the same.
