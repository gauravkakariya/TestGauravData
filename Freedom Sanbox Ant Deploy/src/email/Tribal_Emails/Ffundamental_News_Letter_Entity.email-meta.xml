Here
 is an Associated Press headline which I saw one morning not long ago 
when I turned on my computer and logged on to Yahoo! Finance: “Stock 
Futures Rise On Hope For Greece Bailout” Now, here is another headline, 
also from AP, which later appeared on the self-same Yahoo! Finance: 
“Stocks Down On Greece Default Fears”
 
 
 
 
 
 What

 “I Feel Satisfied &amp; Experience Peace of Mind”
 
 
 
 
 
 When
 I heard term financial planning, I felt it is meant only for the rich. 
 I will not need financial planning as my financial side is under 
control. My conceptions changed when I met Mr. SumeetVaid. I found his 
philosophy of living life freely, after one takes care of family 
risks...

 Why you need Individual health insurance
 
 
 
 
 
 Financial
 products are often confused for most people, and similar sounding 
products sometimes lead one into not realising which product is 
important or not. A common case in point is the two kinds of health 
insurance – individual and group. Most professionals, especially those 
employed with...
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Term Cover + Mutual Funds Vs ULIPs which way should you go?
 
 
 
 
 
 When
 it comes to making investments people are often confused whether to 
opt for a ULIP (Unit Linked Insurance Plan) or a mutual fund. Adding to
 the confusion is that assumption that investment in a ULIP plan and in
 a mutual fund...

 Mother had decided to 

 trim 
 her 
 household budget 

 wherever possible,
 

 so instead of having a 

 dress
 dry-cleaned 

 she washed it by hand.
 

 Proud of her savings, 

 she boasted 
 to my father, 

 Just think, Fred,
 

 we are five dollars richer
 
 because
 I washed this 

 dress by hand. 
 

 Good, my dad quickly replied. 
 

 Wash it again!
