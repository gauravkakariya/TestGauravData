    <subject>The Secret of Multiplying Your Money - Right Way !!</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.LastName}


Do you constantly think of some of the below question, may be it&apos;s time you look for a solution.
Do
you sometimes feel that your money does not work as hard as you do?

 

Is
your family going to be financially secure, whatever happens to you?

 

Do you wish to retire
in the mountains or next to the beach? Is this just a wish, or have you enough
money to turn this wish into reality?


Are you ok with your
hard earned money being parked in a Salary Savings Account earning just 3.50%
p.a. interest? Even if I were to tell you that there are safe enough
investments opportunities available in the markets which yield a much higher
rate of interest?


Isn’t it high time
you wisely invested that 1 lakh which you normally just hastily dump into some
unknown investment avenue every year end to avail the 80C deduction?


We
can’t help you get a better salary hike at the end of the year from your
employer. But what we can do is use our expertise to help you choose efficient
investment opportunities which would generate handy returns for you!

 

Here
is an example -


Kartik
&amp; Joseph both 22 Years old just started their professional career. They
work in the same company earning the same salary of Rs 30,000 per month. Kartik
had a dream to buy a car worth Rs 6,00,000 when he is 27 years of age. He
started to save for this dream and started working on it very early in the
start of his career.

 

He
just saved Rs. 7,000 per month from his salary and invested the amount in the Mutual Fund Scheme for 5 Years.  At
the end of the 5th Year, Kartik could easily buy the car of his
dream. While his friend Joseph still travelled by his old scooter. This is what
the power of Compounding!!

 

Kartik
identified his DREAM and DECIDED to DO something to accomplish it! He planned for his dream and
invested 7,000 per month from his salary for the next 5 years and he got it!!


Financial Planning is a very small price he had to pay to live his dream!
