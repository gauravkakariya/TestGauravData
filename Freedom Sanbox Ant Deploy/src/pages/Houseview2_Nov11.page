                          	 <td valign="top">
                         		<div align="justify">

									<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" style="font-size:12px;">
									The legend goes like this, “If you had invested Rs.10,000 in XYZ IT company stock in the year 1993 you would now be a millionaire. If you had invested the same in ABC company stock in the year 1988 you would now be multi millionaire and so on…” Haven’t each one of us heard this at least once from a stock broker, fund house or may be just a friend who often dabbles in the stock market. 
									<br/>
									<p>Have you ever heard this from anybody who actually did invest Rs.10,000 and become multi millionaire, except of course the promoters of those companies? Somehow there seems to be a lack of logic in citing the above reasons for why one should invest in the stock markets. </p>
									<p> For one, Rs.10000 must have been lot of money in 1988 and only the rich could have afforded to invest in unknown, not so popular stock market. </p>
									<p><em>Two</em>, you could have invested in XYZ, ABC or ended up investing in some other stock which looked promising but did not live up to its promises. How were you supposed to know that among the many companies at that time, it was XYZ or ABC only that would become so big and the others would not? 
									</p>
									<p><em>Thirdly</em>, you should have had the stomach to hold on to it through 1997 – 2003. You might have booked profits or panicked and sold during the great information technology wave. 
									</p>
									<p><em>Fourthly</em>, you should not have had any grave emergency, or you should not have identified a nice little property that you would manage only if you sold this stock. In any case the stock would have been in profits even 7-8 years back and you would have felt no guilt in liquidating it. And many more reasons to why there are no living examples of people who became multi millionaires by simply investing in these super stocks. 
									</p>
									<p>By asking these questions, the idea is not to get skeptical about the stock markets. Far from it. But, to figure out how we should invest? Which is the best tool, the best mode to invest?
									</p>
									<p> As financial planners, we believe in diversification and equities are a very important asset class in the portfolio we design for our clients. Because, it is only with equities, can portfolios return more than inflation rate, be tax efficient and liquid all at the same time. But we never advise direct investments in the stock markets. Our investments in the stock markets are usually, nay always only through mutual funds. 
									</p>
									<p><strong>Why? </strong>- ask many of our existing and prospective clients, sometimes even our own internal members. We want to clarify.
									</p>
									<i><strong>Reason 1 – Mutual funds give almost all the upside of direct stock investments</strong></i>
<br />
 Equity mutual funds invest in the stock markets. They pick and choose good stocks, enjoy the dividends, liquidate when they hear long term bad news and enjoy economies of scale.
<br />
<br />
<i><strong>Reason 2 – But for much lesser assumed risk</strong></i>
<br />
 They diversify, are managed professionally, use high quality research and technology which retail investors like us cannot afford.
<br />

<br />
<i><strong>Reason 3 – Are much easier to buy and sell</strong></i>
<br />
 Oh and the ease of operation, you don’t have to open a demat account which requires signing up sheaves and sheaves of papers and then waiting for 30-45 days for a verdict from the broker whether or not he will take your investments. You just need to get a KYC done and don’t even have to wait for the KYC approval, you can start investing as soon as you apply. Buy and sell online, get the money back in 2-3 days all linked to your savings bank account. 
<br />
<br />
<i><strong>Reason 4 – Are easier to track, review and rebalance</strong></i>
<br />
 And, you can get consolidated statements every quarter. Try this with your demat account and you will understand what a nightmare it could be. You get a statement as soon as you buy and as soon as you sell. If you trade almost every day you can as well forget what you bought, when, for what price etc. With the mutual fund you can sign up to invest a certain sum every week / month for the next 10 years and forget about it. You will promptly get a statement every three months with an update, or you can always check online. When you have to review your holdings or rebalance your portfolio, it’s cool.
<br />
<br />
<i><strong>Reason 5 – Does not become addictive</strong></i>

<br />
 Have you heard of all those resolves to buy and hold stocks forever? The desire to watch prices on a daily basis is but human. It usually starts with 1-2 stocks and then the stock broker starts sending in tips. The portfolio becomes bigger and then you have to sell a few stocks that you bought earlier because they may not do so well in the future and buy a fresh set.  Then it becomes a habit to have your list of stocks on your dashboard and watch it every 3 hours. And then it becomes addictive to buy sell buy sell in the stock markets as if life depended on it. With mutual funds you can watch once a year and that is it. You have better things to do with time, don’t you?
<br />
<br />
If you know clearly what your goals are and what you should invest to reach these goals and that you can get the returns you need from mutual funds with much lesser hassles, what would you do?
To reach your goals, to have a life, to sleep in peace mutual funds it is better to be. That may be at the cost of a small possibility of slightly higher returns.  But that is the tradeoff you will have to make.
