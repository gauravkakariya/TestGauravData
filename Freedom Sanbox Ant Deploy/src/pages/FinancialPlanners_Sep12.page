                                <br />

                                It’s been 4 months of knowing my member who is enrolled with  Ffreedom for achieving his financial goals. Though working in the financial  industry for quite a sometime, he felt the need of assessing his financial  planning through us. In the first meeting with him, I understood that he had a  peculiar style of working with his finances, like he would invest first and  then spend the remaining money as it pleases him and his wife. <br />

                                <br />

                                During our meeting, I understood that this young couple had a  different approach to their future aspirations. He wanted to quit his job and  start some business on his own before he reaches 40, which means he wanted to  accumulate a decent amount of fund that could help him to do that. Also certain  luxuries were also to be planned for. After listening to him patiently for 45  minutes I realised that, as they were young they had dreams which they wanted  to achieve and in their own fashion were also working towards it. <br />

                                <br />

                                I started working towards their plan keeping in mind the  priorities they had and the also the action point for same. As I was working, I  realised that this young couple had to be secured in terms of their emergencies,  also certain ULIP policy had to be stopped.<br />

                                <br />

                                The day I sat with him to present his financial plan I was  really excited to know his feedback and his observations for me and his plan in  whole. We were discussing each goal in detail and prepared an action point for  the same. The conclusion was to build an emergencies fund even before planning  for his goals also the risk planning aspects need to be in place which could be  done by stopping certain policy and buying term insurance for the same. At the  end, after the presentation he told me that though he was serving in the  financial industry and thought that he knew a lot of ways to increase his  wealth and plan in the best possible way he couldn’t do it. The reason being as  he was the one earning and taking decisions for his finances, there was no  rational approach towards it and hence couldn’t finalise on the right approach  that he should take to achieve his goals. I was glad that we could find a  solution to all of his needs and aspirations. In many walks of our life where  we have to choose the best option, it’s better to take the help of someone, who  would not only suggest the way but also guide you till the destiny is achieved.<br />

                                <br />

                                Regards,<br />
