                              Even when you have group health insurance…</em></strong></font></td>

                            <tr>
                              <td valign="top" style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#333333; font-size:12px; text-align:justify;"><p>Financial products  are often confused for most people, and similar sounding products sometimes  lead one into not realising which product is important or not. A common case in  point is the two kinds of health insurance – individual and group.</p>
                                <p> Most professionals,  especially those employed with large and medium sized organisations are offered  a group health insurance policy from their companies. And due to this one often  discounts the need of opting for an individual health insurance policy. </p>
                                <p> Before you make the  choice of relying only on a group health insurance, let us first understand  what each policy offers –</p>
                                <ol>
                                  <li><strong>Individual  health insurance</strong> is purchased by a single person from the private market, either  for oneself or for one's family. A common mistake made by people is that this  type of coverage is meant only for a single person whereas this policy can  cover one individual as well as the entire immediate family.<br />
                                  &nbsp;</li>
                                  <li><strong>Group health insurance</strong> is normally offered to employees of a company  as an additional perk and hence designed for each organization separately. This  type of coverage may also be purchased from the open market, similar to  individual health insurance. </li>
                                </ol>
                                <p> An  important aspect that one needs to remember is that the coverage under a group  health insurance is only valid during one’s tenure in an organization. The  moment one leaves the job, the health cover is lost. This can leave one in a  very delicate situation. Consider the plight of people who lost jobs during the  recession. If someone, who was employed during that phase, fell sick they would  have to bear the medical expenses for their treatment themselves since their former  firm would not be liable to cover them.</p>
                                <p>Relying  solely on a group insurance impacts your retirement too, since the policy will  not cover you post retirement from the job. While there are ways of extending your coverage if your  employer based coverage ends, they are costly and temporary. In fact even if  one is to switch from a group insurance to an individual plan at the age of 40,  at that point of time it is very difficult for him to get individual health  cover or many of the diseases would be excluded or pre – existing diseases  would not be covered since the person of 40 years of age is more prone to get  diseases. Hence, it is advisable to buy health insurance at a very early stage  whether oneis covered with group insurance or not to avoid high medical expenses  occurred, if any, in future.</p>
                                <p> The following are  some of the other advantages of a individual health plan over a group health  insurance – </p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>In group health insurance, one person's bad habits (For E.g. smoking  or drinking) can affect the group rate. However, in individual policy it  depends on the habits of the individual only. </li>
                                  <li>Individual health coverage is often easier to tweak to suit your  needs. If you do not have need for prescription riders, it is easy to remove  them from your individual policy. Group insurance is set by the employer who  chooses the coverage that is best for the majority. What is good for the  majority may not be enough for you or may include unnecessary components. </li>
                                  <li>If you are healthy, it may be cheaper to purchase insurance on your  own. In a group policy, they have averaged high-risk and low-risk people  together. </li>
                                  <li>You can choose coverage that fits your specific needs. Your  monthly premium may not be cheaper, but you can purchase an individual policy  that meets you and your family’s needs for prescriptions and medical care that  will save you money over all. </li>
                                  <li>A major plus of an individual insurance plan is that it is  portable. You can leave your job without any concern that you are jeopardizing  your health care. You do not have to qualify for new insurance, the way you  would if your group health policy is terminated, so you are not at risk for  losing coverage if you have become high-risk. </li>
                                  <li>Getting quotes for individual health insurance is comparatively  easy. </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>When it comes to buying health insurance it is  important to think about what you need and what you can afford. You can choose  from a wide range of innovative policies that give you the optimum benefits and  suits your specific needs. And if you think that the process of understanding a  policy is too difficult, financial planners are there to help you. The best way  is to start as early as it as it comes at a considerably low cost. Also, with  medical expenses rising daily you are at benefit as your cost of insurance  keeps decreasing as time goes by.</p>
                                <p>Remember, your financial plan should first include all  the basics that are required to create a safety net for unforeseen events or  emergencies, and an adequate individual health insurance plan it a vital cog of  that safety net.</p></td>
