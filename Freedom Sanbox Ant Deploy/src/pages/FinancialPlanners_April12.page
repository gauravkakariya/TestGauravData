																	<p>	I have a CFA and CFP under  my belt. I have been referred as one of the sharpest financial planning minds  in the country. 
																		I had reasons to believe I was very good at what I was doing.  And going by the fact that I achieved success quite young,  I sported a fairly large ego.<br />
																		<br />
																		This member and my  experience with him brought me down, back to earth.<br />
																		<br />
																		He was well heeled and had  reasonable assets accumulated over time. He was a busy person, extremely  committed to work. He went to work at 6 am and returned at 9 pm every single  day except Sundays. His financial plan was done but major action points on his  plan remained pending for close to 3-4 months.<br />
																		<br />
																		He would call for meetings  only on Sundays and every meeting would go on for 4-5 hours of detailed  discussions about everything under the sun. <br />
																		<br />
																		I found this a bit  uncomfortable. I was a professional and I felt that my time had to be  respected. I actually had committed to doing certain other things on Sundays.  So at times I would be unable to attend our Sunday sessions and skipped a few  meetings.<br />
																		<br />
																		Obviously, he was unhappy  and made it a point to articulate it. My boss sided with the client making it  very clear that even if the client was wrong or extremely demanding; if a  dispute were to arise he would talk for the client and deem me culpable. <br />
																		<br />
																		I was forced into going  for these Sunday meetings. To my surprise, one by one his pending actions got  completed and he started implementing my suggestions. I realized that he wanted  to talk to somebody. He wanted a friend, somebody who would appreciate his  views and opinions. When given a patient hearing, he was willing to return the  favor and listen. <br />
																		<br />
																		And I had opportunities to  live up to my reputation of being a good financial planner, by convincing him  of our various suggestions and getting him to act on them. Three months later,  his plan is implemented, he is a WOW client, introduces his colleagues and  friends to me and has even passed on a good word about me to the boss. <br />
																		<br />
																		Luckily, I have realized  this early enough that this job is less about being brilliant and more about  being there, empathetic and caring. And this was a full time job, not something  that I can do along with other commitments. 
																		Nothing else can be truer than the  saying that goes – “People don’t care how much you know as long as they know  how much you care”.<br />
